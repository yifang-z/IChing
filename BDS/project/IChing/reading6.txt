Your problem is somewhat tricky to solve, and you are likely to be frustrated and hurt in the process of solving it. You may face some difficulties in your social relationships, and you may have completely different ideas from others when communicating. If other people disagree with the solution you propose, the problem may not be solved, thus making the current situation worse. Therefore, when handling the issue, you should also remember to protect yourself. Alternatively, if you are aware of the dangers in advance, you can take the initiative to update your plan, face the difficulty positively and emerge from the dangerous situation.
We recommend that you solve your problem immediately, without any hesitation. The solution you come up with will not work unless it is specific to your problem. It would help if you were not overly optimistic about the problem; it is best to remain cautious and conservative and listen to experienced people's opinions. If there is no way to find the best solution currently, it may be helpful for you to sacrifice some short-term benefits and lower your expectations in return for long-term benefits. You need to keep away from what is harmful to you, and temporary pain will lead to a better future.
