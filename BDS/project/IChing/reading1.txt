You are a competent person and can almost handle all problems. You will stop to see how the situation will develop when it does not follow the way you want them to and can always find someone with more wisdom and experience to help you solve the problem. You are also a very persistent person who can face challenges and problems positively. Although the problem in front of you may be complex and bother you, you are capable enough to handle them successfully, and the trouble will work out in the end because of your efforts. 
When you deal with the problem, it is vital to be aware of timing and improve your resilience ability. We advise that you should emphasise the opportunity and grasp the chance, and you can adapt to the situation and be flexible when facing the problem. You need to know how to take precautions and be careful to find another plan, and not argue with people excessively. If you are not capable of dealing with your current problems, you should be serious and sincere when asking for help and listen more to the advice of others. If you insist on your way and stick to your ideas, you may get into arguments with others, which will be more detrimental to solving your problems.
