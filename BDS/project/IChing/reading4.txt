You may feel that your problem can be solved, but the whole process of doing so can be a little tricky, and you have to be aware that some troubles may be existed because of this problem. You need to understand how the problem arose, what its source was and why it has remained unsolved until now so that you can better find a solution. You may feel that the problem already torments you; although the immediate situation is not good enough, there is still actually a chance for you to deal with the problem and restart again.
We advise that you not act rashly but focus more on your long-term benefits and not have a high or unrealistic future expectation. You are a person who can handle issues on your own, but you should be careful in solving problems and do not show off your capabilities too much. Otherwise, you could turn the situation into a worse one. Moreover, you are eager to solve the problem but do not aim for the perfect solution. The perfect solution does not exist, and you are unnecessary to waste time on it. The solution you finally choose may seem complicated and hard work, but it will solve your problem in the end.
