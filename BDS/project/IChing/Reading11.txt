11  T'ai  泰

The hexagram consists of two trigrams, Ch'ien below and K'un above, firmness inside and gentleness outside. The hexagram is the combination of Yin and Yang. Yang represents brightness, and Yin represents darkness. Always be right-minded. When the Yang grows, and the Yin subsides, the gentleman will be benefited but not the villain.
