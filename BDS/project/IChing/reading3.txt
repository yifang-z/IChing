Your problem may be complex and vital, which makes you feel very worried. You can choose to avoid the challenge if there is no way to solve it entirely, but you may feel remorseful afterwards. However, if the problem is not solved, you may face a worse situation. You will only feel relieved if the problem is completely resolved. If you have made up your mind to solve the problem, you may find it challenging to get started at first, but you will finally find a solution if you have the determination and courage.
We suggest that you should be proactive and seek helpful advice from elders or people with experience. However, you should not listen to them completely, but take your situation into account. When solving problems, you should focus on communicating with other people, being more considerate of their feelings and not being too arrogant. It is important to stay humble, and you can often review and examine your actions in your communication. If you want others to agree with you, you have to make them understand your opinions or perspective but not make them or force them to follow your ideas.
