Your difficulties are challenging to solve and can leave you with a feeling of desperation. However, if you do not feel anxious and stressed about this, there is still a chance for you to find an effective solution to your difficulties in the early future. In difficult times, your social status is low, and others may not pay attention to your opinions, so it is all the more important to be careful in your daily life and not to make mistakes. Although the current situation is dangerous, difficulties can be solved if you can take the initiative to reflect and think, correct past faults and turn passivity into the initiative. The result of your efforts will take a long time to show, but in the long run, the situation can be improved.
We suggest that you make some changes and do not stick to the status quo. You should value innovation and adopt entirely new solutions. You can do self-reflection, gradually develop your skills and broaden your horizons so that others can recognise you. However, you must not be too impatient. You should observe the current situation and find the right solution. You may be worried that the new approach may go against the past rules, but it is the change that will benefit you in the future.
