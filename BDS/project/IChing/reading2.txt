You are very doubtful about your future. Your problem is not a challenge, but you are still thinking about a more effective solution. The problem did not appear suddenly, and it becomes serious gradually, which is more like a slowly developing process. Although the problem seems troublesome and annoying, it is not insurmountable. If the problem can be dealt with shortly, there is a good chance that a new direction can be found. If you keep waiting indecisively and ignore the problem, it will be detrimental to your future, and some worse conditions may arise.
We recommend that you can think far ahead and plan before you do something. Moreover, if you feel that you are not capable of handling issues, you can prepare in advance. Moreover, you should follow the original route of things, find the correct direction and get things done in a harmonious and joyful way. If you have made up your mind to solve the problem, you should keep this determination and not give it up. Otherwise, the situation will get worse. It would help if you also observed how others do and learn from them, and reflect on yourself to find the right and valuable solution to solve the problem.
