64  Wei Chi  未济

The lower trigram is K’an, the Water, the upper trigram is Li, the Fire. Flame is burning above water, elements are misplaced, and there will be more transition to come. You currently might be in a bad position, but things will be easier if you treat the current situation seriously. Just like yin and yang coexist, an opportunity to be successful will come eventually and it’s up to you to capture it or just let it slip away.
