Your problem will shock and frighten you, and then if you feel alert and introspective, you are likely to be able to solve the problem successfully in the end. Conversely, if you feel that everything is going well now, you need to be aware of the big trouble in the making. So do not be overly afraid of difficulties, be relaxed but determined. If you are brave enough to face the challenge, you will be capable of dealing with it.
We advise you to deal with the problem not based on emotion but use your reason to think of a suitable solution. It would help if you did not immediately solve a problem but think about the suitable solution carefully. Although acting too quickly may allow you to achieve some cooperation and make a difference in the short term, in reality, the cooperative relationship is very fragile and dangerous, and your problem will not be fully solved. You should not be shy when dealing with the problem, but take advantage of the best timing and use your judgement and execution.
