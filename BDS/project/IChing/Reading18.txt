18  Ku  蛊

In this hexagram, the upper trigram is Ken, meaning strongness, the lower trigram is Sun, meaning gentleness. The lack of interplay between strongness and gentleness forms a compulsion for chaos. The image shows that wind blows through the mountains. The result of this hexagram is terrible. If the man can eliminate the damage and cure the chaos, maybe there is a chance for change.
