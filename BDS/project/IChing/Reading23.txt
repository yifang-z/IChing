In this hexagram, the upper trigram is Ken, meaning stop, the lower trigram is K'un, meaning gentleness. High mountains are attached to the ground, which is the symbol of flaking. As the timing, opponent and power are all extremely unfavourable, the man should not make a positive fight. The man can preserve your strength, do not act rashly and wait for the change.
