44  Kou  姤

The upper trigram is Ch'ien, the world, and the lower trigram is Sun, the wind. The wind travels through the world, coming and leaving without a trace, the metaphor for following one's destiny. Many things in this world are destined to happen, so let fate take its course and not force it. Do not bother yourself by pursuing something deliberately.
