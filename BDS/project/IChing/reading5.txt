Although your problem is challenging, you may have encountered similar problems before and are used to solving them with your abilities. Therefore, you are not overwhelmed by your current problem. You can remain optimistic and take positive actions to find an effective solution when facing the difficulty. Moreover, if you believe that you can solve the problem, the solution you are thinking of will most likely come true. Worrying too much about your problem will make you feel stressed and anxious, turning the current situation worse.
We advise that you can insist on your ideas and perspective and not listen too much to what others say. If you have already chosen a suitable solution, you should be determined, do not hesitate, and do not choose to avoid it. Otherwise, you will regret it later. Because of this problem, you become prone to make conflicts or arguments with others, generating discord. If you can remain calm, dealing with the problem without being too aggressive and avoiding making mistakes, you can gain the affirmation and recognition of others. You can also refer to past solutions. If you suddenly go against past practices, it will be more difficult to solve the problem.
