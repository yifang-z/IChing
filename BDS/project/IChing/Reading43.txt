43  Kuai  夬

The lower trigram of this hexagram is Ch'ien, the strongness and firmness. Be resolute and decisive in the face of chaos. If the man cannot decide immediately, he will be affected by the chaos. Whenever in a problematic situation, seize the opportunity to fight back and do not let the villain think you are a good bully. A lack of confidence will only lead to failure.
